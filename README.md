====================

Arm-mounted laser tag crossbow with capacitive touch. Works with the MAGE system: http://mage.okstate.edu/

This was our semester project for ECEN 4013 (Senior Design 1). The archive has the code and circuit diagrams.

The project uses a PIC24H (PIC24HJ64GP502) as the microcontroller, with an NHD OLED display, a MPR121 capacitive touch driver from sparkfun, and the WTV020SD audio board from sparkfun.

Note: I am no longer able to update/fix bugs/polish code on this project, because I no longer have access to the hardware.
